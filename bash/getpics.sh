# this script puts some picture files into a Pictures directory in our home directory
# it does some error testing
# it summarizes the Pictures directory when it is done
#

# Task 1: Improve this script to also retrieve and install the files kept in the https://zonzorp.net/pics.tgz tarfile
#   - use the same kind of testing that is already in the script to only download the tarfile if you don't already have it and  to make sure the download and extraction commands work, then delete the local copy of the tarfile if the extraction was successful

# make a Pictures directory if we don't have one - assumes we have a home directory
test -d ~/Pictures || mkdir ~/Pictures

# download a zipfile of pictures to our Pictures directory if it isn't already there - assumes you are online
test -f ~/Pictures/pics.zip || wget -q -O ~/Pictures/pics.zip http://zonzorp.net/pics.zip

# Checks for the existence of the files from the .tgz file, and if it does note exist, creates the file and downloads
# the necessary files from https://zonzorp.net/pics.tgz. test -f checks to see if the files exists, and the -q and -O
#in wget sets it to quiet and concatenates them to file.
test -f ~/Pictures/pics.tgz || wget -q -O ~/Pictures/pics.tgz https://zonzorp.net/pics.tgz

# unpack the downloaded zipfile if it is there, then delete the local copy of the zipfile
test -f ~/Pictures/pics.zip && unzip -d ~/Pictures -o -q ~/Pictures/pics.zip && rm ~/Pictures/pics.zip

# Does the same as above, but uses the tar command (x: execute, v: verbose to show me what's going on, f: files)
test -f ~/Pictures/pics.tgz && tar -xvf ~/Pictures/pics.tgz -C ~/Pictures && rm ~/Pictures/pics.tgz

# Make a report on what we have in the Pictures directory
test -d ~/Pictures && cat <<EOF
Found $(find ~/Pictures -type f|wc -l) files in the Pictures directory.
The Pictures directory uses $(du -sh ~/Pictures|awk '{print $1}') space on the disk.
EOF
